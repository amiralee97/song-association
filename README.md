# song-association
A simple game of "Song Association"
made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The words are randomly selected from an array list, chosen by me. 
Once you get a word, you are given a 10 second timer to sing a sing 
with the word in the title or lyrics. At the end of the ten seconds, the word disappears and you hit the button for a new word.
